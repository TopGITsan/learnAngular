This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

#### Lesson 1: Arhitecture overview
 - File structure
    - e2e is for testing
    - src (source folder)
        - app (folder) has a css file , html file, ts file with a decorator, and a module file ( a module is a way to split your code to some independent files)
        - main.ts is the entry point, initializes the angular project, bootstrap the application; (flow: main.ts is the main file which bootstraps the module which  bootstraps our components (a component has a decorator) which runs the html file through the template url and includes styles and acts on the selector [in our case <app-root> from our index.html file]).
        - index.html has <app-root></app-root> which gives angular a place to start working
        - polyfills - if the browser doesn't support a particular functionality then polyfill will mimic that particular functionality
        - styles.css - is the global style sheet file
 - Entry point of application
 - Bootstrapping
 - Modules
 - Decorators
 - and some!

 #### Lesson 2: Decorators introduction
 - What is a *decorator* - helps to wrap some function or a class inside another function
 - How it wraps code
 - Makes code easy to read and maintain

 #### Types of decorators
 - Class Decorators
 - Member Decorators
 _the decorator has to be followed by the class you can't have anything in between_

 #### Lesson 3: Lifecycle Hooks
 - OnChanges - if you change some input property this fill be fired
 - OnInit - fired when the component is initialised, it's called only once for component, ideal if you retrive some data from some REST API (perform an HTTP req)
 - DoCheck - fired when angular thinks there is a change, something has changed

 - AfterContentInit
 - AfterContentChecked
 - AfterViewInit
 - AfterViewChecked
 - OnDestroy


 #### Lesson 4: Components
 - What is a component - _a piece of code which represents something on your screen_. it's an independent thing which you can import an use it;
 - Creating component using: ng generate component hello
 - Declaring a component
 - Basic component use


 #### Lessong 5: Interpolation and Expressions
 - What is interpolation
 - Its symbol {{}}
 - Expressions used in interpolation
 - Prohibited expression syntax examples - _do not use functions in your html interpolations_
